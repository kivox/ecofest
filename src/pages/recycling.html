        <h2>Recycling Initiatives</h2>
        <p>At Eco Fest, we believe in minimizing our impact on the environment. Here are some of the recycling initiatives we will be implementing at the festival:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Recycling Bins</h3>
                <p>We will have recycling bins placed throughout the festival grounds to encourage attendees to recycle their waste. The bins will be clearly labeled for paper, plastic, glass, and general waste.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Solar Panels</h3>
                <p>All of the electricity used at the festival will be generated by solar panels. We are committed to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and using sustainable energy sources.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tree-Planting</h3>
                <p>We will be planting trees to offset the carbon emissions generated by the festival. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so planting more trees is an effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of the festival.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
